This project is centered around determining a business' rating based on the quality of the reviews that are given to it.

In order to set up the environment for it, install language_check using the command pip install --upgrade language-check

For some reason there's some trouble due to the language-check library. It's working on one of our systems and having bugs in the other. Apart from that the algorithm and such are implemented.

Also, the language-check takes ages so that's why the dataset is small. So if it takes a while don't worry, it should be running alright.
