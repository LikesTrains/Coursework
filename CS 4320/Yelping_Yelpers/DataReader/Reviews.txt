I've tried places throughout New York and all over Vegas and I cook a wide variety of North and South dishes at home. With Taste of India being open for 3 months now, I wanted to have high expectations for this place. It does seem like a \"hole-in-the-wall\" place given the semi-bad area but anyway, let me start.  My group and I walked in for the Indian Buffet. The place had no customers so we were the only ones. The place looked completely empty and had a rather \"cold\" feeling with little to no decor. We sat down and a couple minutes later were given water with no ice. \nWe were asked what kind of naan bread we wanted then we got up over to the buffet line. While perusing the buffet line, the food didn't really look that appetizing. I got a plate full of few things like jeera rice, chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and mutton korma. \n\nWithin two minutes of eating, I quickly began to lose my appetite and here's why. The rice was extremely overcooked and possibly not made that day. It was very clumpy and soggy and had little to no flavor. Ten minutes later we received our naan (which was undercooked and very doughy) and I began dipping it into the Chicken Tikka Masala. The masala tasted like Campbell's tomato soup (I kid you not). I couldn't eat another bite of it. Everything on my plate was under temperature so my group and I started to worry whether or not we would get sick. Anything from 42-140 degree F is a temperature danger zone. Nothing was hot and the paneer cheese was very cold once bitten into. The tandoori chicken looked \"sad\" sitting there and had no flavor and reminded me of the chicken thighs I used to eat for those horrible school lunches in elementary school. There is nothing genuine about this place and frankly, it's rather sad. I don't know about you but everything about this place needs help. From the lack of decor to the most important part--the food, there is nothing welcoming about this place, it's not traditional, and it's very empty. I honestly felt like I was in that buffet scene in Vegas Vacation.  Indian food is supposed to be fresh and screaming with flavor and I do not know what this place is trying to do. I left with cramping in my stomach and felt horrible for most of the day after this. Maybe it was the combination of the food, or the temp of the food, but it is now not worth going back. \n\nAnother bad part of this experience was we learned that they delivered.  We saw the guy with take-out containers loading them with food from the buffet line. He kept on looking over at our group. Not sure if he didn't want us to see what he was doing? Someone from my group asked if it was for delivery and he said it's for his \"friends.\" Uhhh, what? \n\n Please consider this review. I highly do not recommend coming here.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

When trying a new Indian restaurant (before I get to taste the food which really makes the quality decision), it is a real plus to see Indian customers. I have often seen tables of them here eating which implies to the authenticity of the food. \nI love Indian food, my go to style (along with Thai) while traveling & in the many cities we've lived in. We were going to 2 of the Flamingo restaurants often, until we found this place. I've only checked in 14 times, but have been there more, just sometimes too much in a rush to start savoring some goodies that I forget to grab the phone & checkin. \nUsually we come to the lunch buffet - with our appetites it's definitely the most cost effective time. Being vegan & gluten-free there are still enough choices for me to fill my plate 3 (or more) times. \nFor those that like their food spicy or made to order, this is where they shine. Knowing I like spicy, when I ordered the aloo gobi the best explanation was \"total mouth orgasm\". It was so amazingly perfectly spiced. I was actually annoyed when he took a bite & also liked it so much that the \"wow that's really good\" was followed by stealing more bites. I wanted to take more home than the little bit of sauce that was left. But even that sauce which did come home cuz there was no way I was wasting it, made another awesome dish when baked with some green beans. \nSo obviously I recommend this dish - tell them your spiciness happy point is. \nAlso if you like your uttapam crispy like I do, let them know. They are willing to make the dishes to your preferences (unlike a certain Encino Calif restaurant I won't name here). \nI was told that there are more South Indian dishes available on weekends in addition to what is on the menu.  Which means I really need to try & work a weekend visit in so I can try new dishes since I love to try new tastes - if I can force myself not to order the aloo gobi every non-buffet visit. Granted it is sometimes on the buffet, but since few people enjoy my preferred spice level, it would be more tame. \nOk, this review is ending now because I am obsessing about a dish I now crave but can't get to tonight. Of course I could call them for delivery.....","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

The principle chef is by way of India Palace Las Vegas. Deven Singh is one of the other principle and is a most genuine and polite chap. Talk about a person who knows the pulse of Las Vegas. He's been a LAS resident for 30+ years.\n\nOf course diners should respect the difference between food cooked for the buffet from the extensive menu entrees.

We got put off by the \"no buffet\" thing and started to walk out. The man then told us he would give us 10% off for the inconvenience if we ate there. So, ok, we agreed to stay and they seated us. There were 5 of us but they only gave us 4 menus. I asked if they had more, but they said those were the only ones they had... ok... so I waited for my turn at one of the menus. \nFive minutes later, he took our orders. He said that it will take 15 minutes for us to get our food. We were ok with that since it was around 12:25 and we had time to eat quick and go back to work.... we ended up waiting 30 minutes for our food, so at 12:55 we asked one of our waiters to just pack up our food and we'll just take it to go since we had to get back to work. The waiter started arguing with us and told us we should eat there. What??? He refused to give us to go boxes and insisted we eat there. It took another 15 minutes of us trying to convince this rude guy to give us to go boxes and when we went to pay, they didn't give us the 10% discount that they promised.

I love the culture and the plethora of cuisine that different regions of India have to offer. Out of the MANY Indian places I have tried throughout Las Vegas, Taste of India is THE WORST facility I have ever tried. There are many reasons why.\n\nFirst and foremost, the food. \nAs I entered the place, it was almost completely empty, with only one other table occupied. (they were family of the business). As I chose a table, I walked over to scan the \"buffet\" quickly and was very surprised at what I saw. There was one isle of food, not a great selection to choose from, but just the basics such as chicken korma, tikka masala, jeera rice, etc. All the food I saw looked incredibly unappetizing. I should have left right then and there, but I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. BIG MISTAKE.\nI noticed the food that almost no one has touched, literally caked on the sides of the metal bins that they were sitting in. All the food was above the temperature basin therefore it had dried out from it sitting there most likely for HOURS. All the condiments were sitting in melted ice and looked like they were just thrown in their bin. There were also a couple of flies sitting in them. I was utterly disgusted. \nAt this point I really wanted to feed my insatiable need for Indian food and personally would feel quite bad If I just left this new business. It was a stupid choice that I made.\nI decided to get the tikka masala and the palak paneer and some rice. \nI cannot even describe how bad this excuse for Indian food was. First, all the food that I tried was UNDER PROPER TEMPERATURE. The chicken tikka masala tasted like they mixed canned tomatoes with chicken. It was horrible and room temperature. The palak paneer was not even melted properly and the spinach almost separated from the unknown sauce that it consisted of. What was this?! \nThe rice was flavorless and mushy but clumping together. This means that chances are that this rice is RECYCLED. It was by no means, fresh. Everything tasted so very bland.\nI ordered naan, garlic and plain. It looked very fresh when the guy brought it out, but then I noticed that it was still very doughy. It was not even done baking all the way!\nI started to become very weary of the food that was in front of me, slowly scooping up bite minutes apart and then just giving up. Not even a half hour later I started to feel the effects of FOOD POISONING. Sure enough, it was. I got really sick throughout the day and was vomiting profusely. I was very ill for the next few days unfortunately. \n\nOverall, the food here was a horrible selection of Indian food. The quality is by far a sorry excuse for representing Indian cuisine and these people are INDIAN! I could make a better Indian dish at home and I'm Italian! I am surprised that the health department has not shut down this place for improper food temperatures. People should not be eating here for that reason alone. \nI could go on and on about this horrible restaurant, but I feel that people should be aware of places like this who care more about money than the quality of their food and misrepresenting what Indian cuisine is all about. This place is a shame. I will never go there again.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I thought the tables and chairs were cafeteria-like and the dirty, old carpet we sat next to was unappetizing.

I got some star of anise from the store section and got charged for black garlic, I realized their mistake halfway home, and had to maneuver around a bunch of construction to make my way back.

Tucked behind a bunch of other buildings. If I didn't actively seek this place, I would never have stumbled across it.

It was very artfully presented and the flavor combination are well thought out. The dishes feature a lot of the goods that they sell in the market. \n\nI had the radish salad, corn and crab soup, the pancakes and foie gras and a side of truffle fries. The salad flavor was well balanced...a little sweet, salty from the pancetta and sour and the roots were perfectly roasted.  The corn and crab soup had to grow on me...I hadn't notice that there was lime in the soup on the menu so I was a bit surprised when the soup had a sour note to it, but as I ate it, I just couldn't stop.   The the pancakes were a little more on the sweet side rather than the savory side with all the honey and grapes, but delicious all the same.

In every way possible. It is a candy store for food enthusiasts and chefs. If you're looking for a specialty item or ingredient, it's likely here and if it isn't, you just need to ask!\n\nIt's a fun place to just check out as well. You can learn about these unique foods from the extremely knowledgable Brett Ottolenghi. He is passionate about the products he carries and the people who make them. I love how everything is so carefully curated.\n\nThe best part of this already amazing place is their new cafe powered by Chef Johnny Church. It's lunch only and there are just six seats available. The menu is fun and exciting, which shouldn't be surprising with the access to great ingredients. There's a Prix Fixe option for $35 (basically a chef tasting menu) or you can order a la carte. We requested a couple items, but left the rest of the decisions up to Chef and we were very pleased with the selections!\n\nCorn and Crab Chowder with Espelette Pepper oil and lime crema ($6). A nice warm broth with a light flavor from corn and a touch of crab meat. I loved the welcoming spice from the Espelette pepper.\n\nLion Fish Ceviche with Coconut and Citrus, served with Tempura Wasabi Leaves ($9). A really fabulous interpretation of ceviche with an unique use of coconut milk. This was my first time trying lion fish and it's great - a clean firm, white fish. Lion fish is dubbed \"one of the most aggressively invasive species on the planet\" and they threaten sea life on our Atlantic coast. Brett is an advocate for their consumption, but it hasn't caught on with chefs in town just yet. Either way, this is a wonderful way to try it! Also, it was my first time with wasabi leaves and those are fantastic as well. \n\nPancakes with Seared Sonoma Foie Gras and Three Grape Gastrique ($12). This is so, so amazing. Individual pancakes with delicious foie gras, a cool group of grapes (like Icicle Grapes) and Vermont maple syrup. This is a fantastic combination!\n\nCrispy Brick Chicken Thigh made with Mary's Pasture-Raised Organic Chicken; served with mushroom bread pudding ($11). This delicious chicken thigh goes through quite the process. The thigh's bone is removed, then flayed before being stuffed with a truffle concoction. Then it's sous vide before getting crisped. The result is a succulent, flavorful chicken with crispy skin. \n\nDuck Fat Fries with Sir Kensington's Ketchup. There's nothing to hate when it comes to cooking things in duck fat. I loved the topping of fried thyme and this natural ketchup is very tasty (of course, a product you can purchase here).\n\nZucchini and Squash \"Spaghetti\" with Tomato, Parmesan, Basil; plus, Housemade Burrata ($12). I make zucchini \"pasta\" at home, so I'm a fan of this preparation. I like that this dish was well seasoned and surprisingly flavorful. The creamy Burrata made it that much better.\n\nHexx Chocolate Pot de Crème with Fennel Pollen and Orange Segments ($4). This has a wonderful texture and richness that's thicker than pudding. I loved the semisweet nature of the chocolate and the orange paired really well.\n\nThey plan to change the menu frequently, so I'm happy to visit just as often. The price point is fantastic and I love the exposure to unique ingredients.\n\nHighly recommended: Lion Fish Ceviche, Pancakes with Seared Foie Gras, and Hexx Chocolate Pot de Crème.","useful":6,"funny":2,"cool":5,"type":"review"}

I came with my family for lunch and we were warmly welcomed and seated promptly.   Tables are limited and reserving one is definitely the way to go so be sure to do that. \n\nWe started with the highly talked about grilled cheese sandwich. It ain't your run-of-the mill American cheese variant, nope, not at all.  Montamore cheese provides a sweet start and a tangy (or maybe salty?) zip finish to your tastebuds as you take each bite.  Drizzled with locally produced honey, it's sweet warm gooey heaven in your mouth; the real grilled cheezus has been found!\n\nI had the Piedmontese Truffle and Foie Burger.   Super lean beef but still flavorful, you can indulge without feeling an ounce of shame. A truffled egg and gouda cheese tops this medium rare beauty.  What wasn't present (or just not consistent) was the thick piece of foie gras seen in some Yelp photos.  (FOIE was the reason I came here!)  So either they skimped on my slice or cooked it to the point of it melting away (now foie butter?) but there was still slight disappointment.  Although still pretty good, I hope they get their dishes consistent.  Bring back the foie!\n\nNow the Crispy Brick Chicken Thigh over Mushroom Bread Pudding that my wife ordered is to die for.   This was the sleeper that blindsided me by it's surprising burst of flavor.  The chicken is expertly cooked with black truffles accenting it and the mushroom bread pudding was fantastic.  I'll absolutely order this again. \n\nWe finished up with a dessert, Hexx Chocolate, Pot De Creme topped with slices of Mandarin Oranges.    Very rich and delicious, small but satisfying.  \n\nBe sure to explore the store aspect which connects to the cafe after eating.  There are plenty of organic and locally produced products in here for purchase.  Buy some foie, see the lionfish tanks, and above all, have a well-satisfying lunch when you visit here.\n\nYelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 9\/100","useful":23,"funny":16,"cool":20,"type":"review"}

I know for a fact that this is gonna be a popular spot just by seeing no empty tables as we arrived,  so we just checked out the store area while we waited for a table to open up.\n\nIts a very spacious area sharing space with the market area, aquatic tanks, and the kitchen where diners may take a peek at the action where Chef Johnny Church and crew get down. Seeing fellow Yelpers check ins and food pix, I booked a reservation for  lunch and we were set to go. Here is a breakdown of our meal...\n\nLIONFISH CEVICHE WITH TEMPURA SHISO LEAVES \n\nI always look for items and  preparations  that I have never tried, so we originally planned to get the Jellyfish  Calamari with Squid Ink Aioli but they had a hard time getting the Jellyfish in, so we passed on that and  got the ceviche. Although it was beautifully presented  alongside the Tempura Shiso  (the menu says  Wasabi Leaves ) the Asian spices and influences used overpowered the lionfish, so it was difficult to find the flavor of Lionfish,  and if another type of fish was used, I still couldn't tell the difference. If you look at other ceviche pictures, the finished plates are inconsistent which could be a disappointment if and when you dine here and get something other than the delicious looking picture that persuaded you to check this place out? Know what I mean???The shiso leaves were tasty though. \n\nPANCAKES WITH SEARED SONOMA FOIE GRAS AND THREE GRAPE GASTRIQUE \n\nA take on breakfast with foie gras instead of butter and the gastrique instead of maple syrup had my palette lost in translation. Again, the presentation was nice, but the foie gras was not only thin and tiny, but borderline overcooked. The warm grapes didn't seem to do this plate any justice either. The components just didn't jive with each other. Not too fond of this one.\n\nPIEDMONTESE FOIE AND TRUFFLE BURGER  \n\nLoved the flavors of this burger! Perfect temp (medium rare of course!) gooey egg, BUT AGAIN inconsistencies! Lookit, before I dined here, I saw Nik O.'s pic of the burger with a nice piece of seared foie on the burger...cool! I order the burger and see NO FOIE on my burger, but foie butter like it says on the menu...didn't think anything of it cause it doesn't say SEARED foie, but yesterday, I come across a good friends IG pic of the burger WITH a nice piece of seared foie??? So I get a skimpy , overcooked piece on the pancakes, and short changed on the burger?  Is there an additional charge or secret code I needed to know about? WHAT DA FOIEK!?!?!?! Duck fat fries were soggy and forgettable btw...\n\nCRISPY BRICK CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOM BREAD PUDDING\n\nThis dish, I'd return for...Sous vide organic chicken thigh stuffed with black truffles, sealed with what's known as \"meat glue\" and crisped up on the stovetop and paired with a delicious savory mushroom bread pudding. Definite winner here.\n\nAll in all, an A-OK visit to the cafe, with a definite return to the store side for sure, but still on the fence for a return dining experience...Just be warned that you may not get exactly what you see in these pictures...

We bought a Groupon for a set menu and made reservation ahead of time, but when we showed up it looked like they did not have our reservation and were not prepared for our set menu. I am not sure if something was wrong with Groupon therefore they did not know we were coming or they were simply not prepared.\n\nHowever, we were seated and quickly served. I ordered French pressed coffee, this is big enough for 2-3 people to drink and was only $5 I think. \n\nThe food was pretty good but I did not like that a few of our dishes were served together, family style instead of each of us having our own separate plate. We bought 3 Groupons for five course set. The first two courses: beef tartare and Caesar salad were served family style, not a big deal but I am used to getting separate plates when I do set menus. The beef tartare was ok but the Caesar salad was delicious, I am usually not a fan of Caesar but their dressing was homemade so it is very light, they put an egg on top which was such a nice touch. \n\nAfter that we got the tomato soup which I did not like at all, but I don't any tomato soups to begin with so this is probably not their fault. Then came the pappardelle pasta with mushroom was so good, the sauce was just perfect but very oily, after finishing the plate there were plenty of oil left on our plate. Not a big deal to me but might bother some people. \n\nLastly is their foie gras pancakes... I think this is served as dessert. This was the BEST thing about the whole place. I am a fan of foie gras, I will eat it anywhere and anytime.. but foie gras and pancakes?? Sounds strange but it works!! The tiny pancakes, with the sweet grapes and the foie gras on top... the sweetness of the grapes and the saltiness of the foie gras just worked perfectly!! Wish the portion was bigger... \n\nI am pretty sure that these dishes are on the regular menu too so you don't have to buy the set menu to try these items. They also have a little \"market\" in the restaurant where you can buy cheeses and cured meats, you can also buy oils and spices, although you can find the same oils and spices for cheaper at other places.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I would have never found it if it weren't for a friend recommending it when I was asking for a place to buy caviar. I used to get caviar at Caviar Baron. But as that is not something I buy very often, regretfully it had been easily a couple of years and to my dismay had closed awhile back. But I was on the hunt as I had a fun girls weekend planned with my bestie and her mom. So when a friend recommended Artisinal Food and I found out quickly they are located around the corner from my work in the warehouse district by the airport, I could not wait to investigate! Upon walking in I was a bit puzzled as there were a few dining tables towards the front. Apparently they have all kinds of fun cooking and sampling demonstrations. I quickly signed up for the newsletter! I was a little overwhelmed at first as I'm hardly a connoisseur, but the nice gentleman working there was patient and extremely helpful. I picked out three types one being the coveted beluga which he informed me just recently became available again in this country. Each tin came with a complimentary mother of pearl spoon which is absolutely necessary for proper caviar serving. They also carry creme fraiche and blinis to round it out. While I was there I admired all of the gourmet products. Most of which I have only seen before on menus of expensive restaurants or on shows like Top Chef. I couldn't resist picking up a few things while I was there. Suddenly iberico ham, marcona almonds and fermented black garlic were added to my basket for no particular reason except I wanted it!

I was impressed with ingredients and preparations I don't normally see.  Tremendous creativity.  One of the last things I would have ordered would be the pancakes.  Yet, it was an excellent dish with a mix of three kinds of grape made into a gastrique and served with foie gras topping the small stack of mini pancakes.  Fantastic flavors and since I don't use maple syrup, a delight having a sweet that was so different with pancakes.\n\nChef Church asked me which pasta of two on the menu I wanted.  I looked at both and went with the Bolognese.  What he did was serve me the Bolognese with the hand cut pappardelle which was the other pasta.  The pork sausage, ground lamb, and chicken liver confit along with the tomato and mirepoix provided a great pasta.  The Bolognese was very rich.\n\nI need mention the soup.  The curry squash soup had a very good flavor of curry and was a delightful soup on this cold day.\n\nFinally, the crispy chicken thighs on mushroom bread pudding was outstanding.  Chicken thighs cooked and removed from the bone, then put back together with a layer of truffle and quickly fried crispy and served on the bead of mushroom bread pudding.  Outstanding!\n\nFinishing off with a light dessert of Hexx chocolate pot de crème topped with orange slices and topped with fennel pollen.

I am not someone who craves burgers, but this is what I want in my life. Its perfectly seasoned and rich - no need to doll with some condiments.

I like the addition of the egg in it so that it isn't your typical cold cut sandwich with some vinegar and oil.\n\nHexx Pot de creme is rich and smooth and just enough after a full meal. \n\nThe french toast reads more like a bread pudding to me, but it was nice with the fresh applies. \n\nDo try their ice tea as it changes daily and have been all solid. We've had a pomegranate with fresh pomegranate in it, a fragrant jasmine style one, and a smooth black tea with lemon in it. Coffee is nice local stuff in a french press. \n\nThe service is always friendly from miss Carrie (sp?). She's super nice and makes sure to check on people often. \n\nI cannot wait for the seasonal menu changes. I live across town in the NW, but we make the trip to the SE for this place. What's genius is that after eating a meal that makes me happy about food, I get inspired. I then walk a few steps to the wall and buy a few ingredients! \n\nExciting menu, fair price points for the quality you are getting. Big, big fan.","useful":11,"funny":8,"cool":13,"type":"review"}

It is a unique cafe, in the middle of a grocer of fine foods, at a location I would never have ventured, if not for the rave reviews and vivid food pix shared by yelpers. \n\nEverything on the menu looked great, so instead of choosing, I was excited to try the 5 course tasting menu. I was going to write a long play-by-play of the experience, but I'll cut to the chase. Food quality and flavor was absolutely top notch, truly flavorful, and beautifully plated. Absolutely no complaints about the cooking or the food. \n\nHowever, I was sorry to be disappointed in a few things.  First, while very polite, the service was weird, for lack of a better word that might come across too harsh. Timing of each course was off-putting. Courses were either 10 min wait in between or came at the same time. Also, was not offered anything but water to drink, and had to ask for refills. Chef came to the table few times, I think.  His comments of \"my this... and my that\" sounded like it came from a chef but he never introduced himself, just described the dish. \n\nSecond, the portions were quite small, unlike previous reviewers pix (like Norm K on 12\/2\/15).  Every course except the octopus carpaccio and the desert could be eaten in one bite. The brick chicken and mushroom bread pudding was absolutely fantastic, but only a small slice of chicken atop a spoon-size serving of pudding. I wasn't even particularly hungry to start with, but felt A little shorted. Judge for yourselves from my pix. \n\nThat said, i do believe this is a gem of a spot and I would like to try again.

I dig the concept: selling specialty ingredients for home cooking, and showcasing store products at an on-site café! Menu is limited, but everything we tried was great. This is definitely a spot to make reservations, as seats are limited. Come hungry and bring a couple of friends- I wish I'd had an extra person or two with me to order the entire menu to share!\n\nJELLYFISH \"CALAMARI\" FRIES WITH SQUID INK AIOLI: The best calamari ever! Breading was light, seemed to be cornmeal based, and did not adhere so well, but this was the best-tasting calamari or jellyfish dish I've had. Bright, acidic, fresh, with that great squid ink aioli. Wanted to lick the plate. A must-order, great start to our meal.\nLIONFISH CEVICHE: It was a bit sad to order and consume this dish while staring directly at a lionfish in the tank beside us. But lionfish are the cockroaches of the ocean and they need to be eaten! (True story, Google it.) The ceviche itself was very citrusy and the flavor of the lionfish was not the star of the dish, it seemed to be overpowered by the other ingredients. But the tempura shiso leaves were the best vessel for eating this! BF said he wouldn't get this again, but I am open to other versions of lionfish.\nMADE TO ORDER CAESAR: The Worcestershire flavor is more pronounced in this version than in others I've tried. Portion is easily shareable, the egg was perfectly poached.\nMONTEAMORE GRILLED CHEESE ON BAGUETTE WITH LOCAL HONEY: This dish is where my BF finally \"got it\" about why I was so anxious to come here ASAP. This is the best grilled cheese. It's not a traditional version, but it's crisp and buttery, with a bright, salty cheese balanced well by the use of local honey and plated with house-made pickles. Portion is small like the price tag ($6), great for sharing as a starter.\nCRISPY BRICK CHICKEN THIGH: WOW. The chicken thigh itself is so tender, and served atop a wonderful savory mushroom bread pudding. I cook with chicken thigh a lot, and don't particularly care for the texture of bread pudding, so I almost didn't order this but it really was amazing. The chopped chives on top added just the right amount of verdant freshness.\nHANDCUT PAPPARDELLE PASTA: BF's entrée choice at our server's recommendation, reminiscent of a beef stroganoff, sans beef. The pasta was thin, delicate ribbons, married with a heap of roasted mushrooms and artichokes. Great dish.\nCROISSANT FRENCH TOAST: BF's dessert pick, lots of flavors and textures going on here. Bread wasn't too thick, caramel apple cider sauce wasn't too sweet, and the fresh julienned green apples on top were a great accent. \nHEXX CHOCOLATE POT DE CREME: Simple but very good. Three slices of orange over a pot of rich chocolate mousse, with fennel pollen. I can't honestly tell you what the pollen tastes like but everything came together well- and this coming from someone who usually shies away from dishes that combine chocolate and citrus. \n\nThe new industrial location is near their former dwelling, but with increased floor space and a kitchen. Adding the café concept is wonderful, and Vegas needs more spots like this that highlight local talent (both cooking and sourcing!) in a way that locals can appreciate. This is making the shortlist of places we will be bringing visiting friends and relatives. Hopefully they will expand hours at some point as they settle in.","useful":16,"funny":11,"cool":17,"type":"review"}

The pots de creme for dessert featured the Askinosie Chocolate they sell. The lionfish was the most-stunning dish we tried, although a little unfair to compare to delicious Mary's pasture-raised organic chicken. Apparently they sell fresh lionfish, or will soon. It was so hard to choose from menu we had six different dishes plus dessert - for lunch for two.

Therefore I love this place! My favorite flavors are the original hot, garlic parmesan and lemon pepper, with the bone in of course! Chicken wings are NOT boneless  sauces don't come with , you have to pay extra...this is not fast food!  sauces not free! hehe and it does takes about 12minutes after you order because it's fried to order. once in a lucky while, they will miscount and you get an extra wing! maybe making up for the size of wings? sometimes they are smaller than usual.\n\nIt's great to have this location so close except for the fact that it's in the casino and you have to park and walk to it. So ordering from home takeout can be a little humbug but if your craving for the wings you do what you have to do! sometimes after we watch a movie we have a craving we will order out. or we eat before going to the movies. \n\nIt's nice when my sister and brother used to stay here, because they also loved these wings and would bring them over for dinner. now they stay at Red Rock where there isn't a wingstop. but then again, they also opened up in Hawaii now, so it's not as special to them.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The size of the individual wings are very substantial indeed, but the taste and texture is what captivated me. The lemon pepper wings have a lofty balance of salty and crispy while still offering flavor. The teriyaki wings were quite tasty too, but the lemon pepper was by far the star performer.

However, 65% of the time that I've been here they have been very nice and accommodating especially since I order A LOT of wings to take home to my family.\n\nFood: Umm, well.. This place used to super amazeballs. It was so amazebally good that I picked this place over BWW. Never again, unfortunately. Their boneless wings are super salty. I wanted to throw 'em away. And their classic wings don't have enough sauce on them and are also a bit too much on the salty side. My favorite sauce however is Hickory smoked BBQ.

Sucked, big time for me to even consider taking time out of my schedule to write this review. (I never write reviews!)\n\nTried to call in an order and was literally placed on hold for over 15 minutes. I purposely waited patiently thinking, \"Ok, they must be busy. Someone will pick up and courteously ask me to remain on hold for a bit longer.\" NO, didn't happen. Not even once. \n\nI hung up and called right back, and before I could greet her again I was getting ready to be automatically placed on hold again until I yelled out, \"Wait! I've already been on hold for 15 minutes. Can you please just take my order real quick. I know what I want. It's simple.\" Angela said she was the only one there with a line out the door. Well, if she had taken my order over the phone within the first 5 minutes of holding, or told me that they couldn't take phone orders at that time, I could have driven over & had my food within the same time frame that I was placed on hold. She wanted to place me on hold for another 15 minutes until she got her line taken care of. WTH!\n\nThey need to have more cashiers during rush hour or close phone hours during that time. Something has to give in the name of Customer Service. How many orders did they miss by not having someone there to take phone orders only during rush hour, 5pm on a Monday? Many!\n\nAs far as food...\nTried the Atomic Hot, and those are just ridiculously hot for no reason. No flavor...just way beyond habanero spicy, like they picked every possible super spicy herb & said \"Just throw it on there\". Sauce dropped on my arm and literally whelped my skin. Even my finger tips burned from the sauce. o.O No Bueno!\n\nTried the Chile Lime...tastes like they just used Taco Seasonings with a splash of lime. They were okay, but I was in the mood for chicken wings, not tacos. Palette was confused.\n\nI guess the best thing to do is to Keep It Simple...Lemon Pepper & Original Hot...Plus choose a location that has better customer service. Which means, I probably won't be eating Wingstop anytime soon because I'm not driving across town to another location. My hubby's homemade Lemon Pepper & Hot Wings are AWESOME!

This WS happened to be located inside the Sante Fe Station and for a Sunday night it was busy. If your looking for a variety of flavors, you're not going to find that here. They have about 7 basic flavors and if you get an order of 15 wings, you can only mix and match TWO. Kinda lame. So anyway, I tried the Parmesan and original style hot. The Parmesan was \"good\" and the original tasted like it was tossed in Tabasco sauce and I wasn't very impressed. The quality of chicken is OK, I've definitely had better. I thought it was a bit pricey for the amount they give you and the quality. \n\nSo for now BDubbs is still my fave, but Wings Stop is not a terrible place to stop by when you're hungry and in the mood for wings.
